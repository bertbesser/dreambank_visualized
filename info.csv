"Samantha is a college-educated woman in her twenties who volunteered her dream journal in September, 1999. It is first of all of interest because it is one of the most contemporary dream journals we have from someone under 30. It is also of interest because the dream narratives are often longer than in many journals. We purposely know nothing about her.  Samantha's relationships to the named characters in her dreams are listed at the end of each dream report. All names have been changed, and they are consistent throughout the series.  (E.g., ""Walter"" starts out as an ex-boyfriend and later becomes a boyfriend, but it is the same person.)",samantha,63,Samantha: in her 20s,female,1992-1999

"""Melora"" was a 23-year-old college student, the wife of a graduate student in psychology, and a new mother when she tape-recorded 144 of her dreams between June 19 and December 1, 1962. This is a remarkable number of dreams for 5+ months, making this series useful for  studying the consistency of dreams over a short time period.  Since she often remembered two or more dreams a night, this is also a very good series for anyone who wants to search for similarities in the dreams of a single night. Then, between January 11, 1963, and  September 24, 1965, she wrote down another 67 dreams.This series is invaluable most of all because we also have 128 of her husband's dreams for the same time period (see ""Melvin""). It is interesting to compare how often they dream of each other and of their little daughter, and to see how each portrays the other. Their dreams from the same night also can be compared, but it must be said that an earlier comparison of the two series by Calvin S. Hall did not turn up any patterns.(For further information about Melora, click here.)",melora,211,Melora (Melvin's wife),female,1962
"Kenneth began this amazingly detailed series of dreams during his first year in college, writing down every dream he recalled for the next three years, sometimes two or three a night: he reports that he'd typically wake up multiple times per night and jot down extensive notes of the dream imagery, actions, characters, and emotions.  The next day he would write the dream down in full based on thesenotes, which often took more than an hour each day.  Therefore, this is the most complete home dream series we have.  It is also the best series we have from anyone under age 21.  It shows great consistency in its major characters and themes over the three-year period, but has not been studied in detail.  It shows how realistic dreams can be for some people.",kenneth,2022,Kenneth,male,1996-1998

"There are two sets of dreams from this Vietnam War veteran, who had nightmares about his intense combat experience for decades after he returned to the United States. The first set consists of 98 dreams, including many nightmares, that he recorded off and on for more than 30 years after he left Vietnam (1971 to 2008).  The second set of dreams, consisting of 32 dream reports, was written down over a three-week period in 2015 (at age 66) at our request, shortly after he contacted dreambank.net to offer his nightmare journal for future research.

"Barb Sanders (not her real name) is a middle-aged adult woman who has written down most of her dreams since about 1977. The series is ideal for detailed studies, for several reasons: (1) we have interviewed Sanders and her friends at length, so we can provide background information after analyses are made; (2) we have done numerous studies of the dreams that can be built upon with new methods -- these studies are discussed in Chapter 5 of G. William Domhoff's book The Scientific Study of Dreams (2003); (3) the series is so extensive that it is extremely useful for studying subsets on specific issues (e.g., how she interacts with her ex-husband Howard, or how she reacted to an infatuation with Derek, or how she conceives of each of her three siblings and three children, or how she conceives of cats and dogs, or what happens when she is on or near bridges).

Except for nine months in the U.S. Army in 1918-1919, he worked as a natural scientist for the federal government until his early retirement due to declining health in the late 1940s.  There is no information on the life of the dreamer except for what appeared in a four-page obituary in a scientific journal.

But are his interpretations plausible?  Does he understand his own dreams?  To answer that question for yourself, you can make your own analysis and then compare it with his.

"The dream reports in this collection come for one of the earliest and most extensive studies of dream content ever conducted in the sleep laboratory.  They are the only set of dreams in the DreamBank that includes dream reports collected in a sleep lab.  In addition, the set also includes dreams written down at home from the same young adult males who were studied in the lab.  The study was carried out in 1963-1964 at the University of Miami by Calvin S. Hall and Robert Van de Castle with a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The main results can be found in a paper by Domhoff and Schneider in the Dream Library on dreamresearch.net.  Their findings show that home and lab dreams differ mainly in terms of the greater amount of physical aggression in home dreams.

"There are two sets of dreams from this Vietnam War veteran, who had nightmares about his intense combat experience for decades after he returned to the United States. The first set consists of 98 dreams, including many nightmares, that he recorded off and on for more than 30 years after he left Vietnam (1971 to 2008).  The second set of dreams, consisting of 32 dream reports, was written down over a three-week period in 2015 (at age 66) at our request, shortly after he contacted dreambank.net to offer his nightmare journal for future research. Although much has been written about the PTSD dreams of war veterans, this is the only journal we know of that contains a series of nightmare reports written down shortly after they occurred. Similarly, there are no everyday dream diaries we know of from a combat veteran who suffers from PTSD that consist of all the dreams that were written down daily over at least a two-week period.For more info about this man's life during and after the war, including a glossary of some of the military jargon used in the dream reports, click here.",vietnam_vet,98,Vietnam Vet: 1970-2008 war dreams,male,1970-2008
